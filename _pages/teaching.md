## Startup Experience
* <a style='color:lightsalmon'>Shree Bherunath Granite, Rajsamad, India</a> (2014-2016)
  - Helped my family setup granite mines and played a key role in overseeing the day-to-day operations of the firm supervising 20 employees and has made significant contributions to the efficiency and productivity of our team.
* <a style='color:lightsalmon'>Kevin Technology, Ajmer, India</a> (2016-17)
  - Co-founded a start-up with a vision to develop 2016-17 surveillance system based on computer vision techniques.

## Industrial Experience
* Masters Thesis at [WeDiagnostiX](https://wediagnostix.com/en/home) (Feb 2019 - July 2019):
  * __Advisor__: [Prof. Hugues Talbot](https://hugues-talbot.github.io)
  * __Project__: Masters Thesis with a Dental AI startup where I developed first working prototype for the classification/understanding of maxillary structures from X-ray imaging using Deep learning. My responsibilities included creating an end-to-end pipeline, starting with data collection and labeling till building a working prototype.

* Summer Internship with [Quelia Systems Inc.](https://quelia.fr/}) (July 2018 - Aug 2018): 
  * __Advisor__: [Prof. Hugues Talbot](https://hugues-talbot.github.io)
  * __Project__: During the summer internship, I was tasked to build an application for estimating tyre wear using a portable mobile camera and computer vision technique. With the software developed, any person can approximate the depth of the treads and accordingly take action to replace them if needed.
