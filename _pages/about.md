Hi, I'm Mohit Vaishnav, an AI researcher turned entrepreneur.

I co-founded **[Kimova AI](https://kimova.ai)** to revolutionize cybersecurity compliance using Artificial Intelligence, focusing on standards like ISO 27001. We're proud to be backed by the **Google Cloud Startup Program**.

My work is driven by insights from my **Ph.D. in AI and Cognitive Science** ([Brown University](https://serre-lab.clps.brown.edu/) / [ANITI](https://aniti.univ-toulouse.fr/)), where I explored how attention and memory mechanisms enhance machine **visual reasoning**. ([Thesis details](/phd_thesis/)).

My journey includes diverse experiences bridging fundamental research and deploying practical AI solutions across academia and industry. ([See my journey](/experience/)).

I'm passionate about building impactful, human-aligned AI. Let's connect!
