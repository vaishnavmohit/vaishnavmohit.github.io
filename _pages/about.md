Driven by a passion for leveraging AI to solve complex real-world problems, I co-founded [Kimova AI](https://kimova.ai). We are pioneering the use of AI in ISO auditing, specializing in cybersecurity and compliance solutions, particularly for ISO/IEC 27001:2022. Our mission is to make robust security compliance more accessible and efficient, and we're proud to be supported by the Google Cloud Startup Program in this endeavor.

My journey into AI entrepreneurship builds upon a strong foundation in research. I earned my Ph.D. exploring the fascinating intersection of **Artificial Intelligence, Cognitive Science, and Computer Vision**, working between the [Artificial and Natural Intelligence Toulouse Institute (ANITI)](https://aniti.univ-toulouse.fr/) in France and [Brown University](https://serre-lab.clps.brown.edu/) (USA) under the guidance of Prof. Thomas Serre. My doctoral research focused on understanding **visual reasoning** in machines, investigating how mechanisms like **attention and memory**, inspired by human cognition, could enhance AI capabilities, particularly in abstract reasoning tasks. You can find more about my thesis [here](/phd_thesis/).

Prior to founding Kimova AI, I gained diverse experience across industry and academia. I worked as a **Data Scientist** at Sandvik's Center for AI and Automation and as a **Researcher** at the German AI Research Center (DFKI), contributing to projects in automated mobility and deploying end-to-end AI solutions. Earlier, I developed foundational prototypes for AI applications in dental imaging during an impactful internship at the startup [WeDiagnostiX](https://wediagnostix.com/en/home).

I hold an Erasmus Mundus Joint Master's Degree in Vision and Robotics (VIBOT) from universities in the UK, France, and Spain, and a B.Tech (Hons.) in Electronics and Communication Engineering from [LNMIIT](https://www.lnmiit.ac.in/), India.

I'm always interested in exploring new frontiers in AI and discussing how technology can be thoughtfully applied to tackle significant challenges. Feel free to connect via the links below!
