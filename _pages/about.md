<!-- I am a Ph.D. student at Artificial and Natural Intelligence Toulouse Institute <a href="https://aniti.univ-toulouse.fr/">ANITI</a> working with <a href="https://serre-lab.clps.brown.edu/">Prof. Thomas Serre</a> at Brown University.  -->
I am currently the co-founder of [Kimova AI](https://kimova.ai), an ISO auditing company specializing in cybersecurity and compliance solutions. We are at the forefront of revolutionizing how companies approach gap assessment for ISO/IEC 27001:2022 compliance. Kimova AI is proudly supported by the Google Cloud Startup Program, allowing us to utilize Google Cloud's resources to accelerate our growth.

Previously, I worked as a consultant, providing solutions in the fields of computer vision and AI. This role involved leveraging my expertise to address challenges and offer innovative approaches in these domains.

During my Ph.D. studies, I focused on exploring the intersection of Artificial Intelligence, neuroscience, and computer vision. My research delved into understanding visual reasoning abilities in machines and comparing them with human capabilities. I investigated the limitations of modern AI networks in solving abstract reasoning tasks and drew insights from neuroscience to evaluate human abilities like memory and attention.

<!-- Before joining this Ph.D. I interned at a start-up, <a href="https://wediagnostix.com/en/home" target="_blank">WeDiagnostiX</a> (Paris, France), in dental imaging, where I developed their first working prototype. The company at that time existed only in the thoughts and discussions of a maxillofacial surgeon with an academic professor. I was tasked to be the torchbearer and explore the research direction singlehandedly. My responsibilities included collecting data, doing the labeling and building a working prototype for teeth segmentation and classification using X-ray images. I had to think of innovative ways to complete the task and eventually succeeded. -->

<!-- The aim was to analyze dental radiograph images to build an "Automatic Clinical Investigation" device, improving dental care quality using AI techniques. -->

<!-- I earned my Joint Erasmus MS in Computer Vision and Robotics from Heriot Watt University (UK), University of Bourgogne (France), University of Girona (Spain).  -->

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com){:target="\_blank"}. You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too.
