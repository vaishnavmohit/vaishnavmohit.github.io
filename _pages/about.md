I am a Ph.D. student at Artificial and Natural Intelligence Toulouse Institute <a href="https://aniti.univ-toulouse.fr/">ANITI</a> working with <a href="https://serre-lab.clps.brown.edu/">Prof. Thomas Serre</a> at Brown University. My research interest focuses on exploring the role of self-attention in cognitive architecture and CNN. I am currently working on modeling attention and memory mechanism inspired by biological systems. Before joining this Ph.D. I interned at a start-up, <a href="https://wediagnostix.com/en/home">WeDiagnostiX</a> (Paris, France), in dental imaging, where I developed their first working prototype. The aim was to analyze dental radiograph images to build an "Automatic Clinical Investigation" device, improving dental care quality using AI techniques.

I earned my Joint Erasmus MS in Computer Vision and Robotics from Heriot Watt University (UK), University of Bourgogne (France), University of Girona (Spain).

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com){:target="\_blank"}. You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/){:target="\_blank"} and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/){:target="\_blank"}, like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
