Incorporating self-attention with ResNet50, we enhance feature maps using feature-based and spatial attention, achieving efficient solving of challenging visual reasoning tasks. Our findings contribute to understanding the attentional needs of SVRT tasks. Additionally, we propose GAMR, a cognitive architecture combining attention and memory, inspired by active vision theory.

Here, we present a novel module for visual reasoning, the Guided Attention Model for (visual) Reasoning (GAMR), which instantiates an active vision theory -- positing that the brain solves complex visual reasoning problems dynamically -- via sequences of attention shifts to select and route task-relevant visual information into memory. Experiments on an array of visual reasoning tasks and datasets demonstrate GAMR's ability to learn visual routines in a robust and sample-efficient manner. In addition, GAMR is shown to be capable of zero-shot generalization on completely novel reasoning tasks. Overall, our work provides computational support for cognitive theories that postulate the need for a critical interplay between attention and memory to dynamically maintain and manipulate task-relevant visual information to solve complex visual reasoning tasks."  },  {    "@context": "https://schema.org",    "@type": "ScholarlyArticle",    "name": "Understanding the Computational Demands Underlying Visual Reasoning",    "author": {      "@type": "Person",      "name": "Mohit Vaishnav"    },    "datePublished": "2022",    "url": "https://doi.org/10.1162/neco_a_01485",    "description": "Visual understanding requires comprehending complex visual relations between objects within a scene. Here, we seek to characterize the computational demands for abstract visual reasoning. We do this by systematically assessing the ability of modern deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn to solve the synthetic visual reasoning test (SVRT) challenge, a collection of 23 visual reasoning problems. Our analysis reveals a novel taxonomy of visual reasoning tasks, which can be primarily explained by both the type of relations (same-different versus spatial-relation judgments) and the number of relations used to compose the underlying rules. Prior cognitive neuroscience work suggests that attention plays a key role in humans' visual reasoning ability. To test this hypothesis, we extended the CNNs with spatial and feature-based attention mechanisms. In a second series of experiments, we evaluated the ability of these attention networks to learn to solve the SVRT challenge and found the resulting architectures to be much more efficient at solving the hardest of these visual reasoning tasks. Most important, the corresponding improvements on individual tasks partially explained our novel taxonomy. Overall, this work provides a granular computational account of visual reasoning and yields testable neuroscience predictions regarding the differential need for feature-based versus spatial attention depending on the type of visual reasoning problem."  },  {    "@context": "https://schema.org",    "@type": "ScholarlyArticle",    "name": "Conviformers: Convolutionally guided Vision Transformer",    "author": {      "@type": "Person",      "name": "Mohit Vaishnav"    },    "datePublished": "2022",    "url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.08900",    "description": "Vision transformers are nowadays the de-facto preference for image classification tasks. There are two broad categories of classification tasks, fine-grained and coarse-grained. In fine-grained classification, the necessity is to discover subtle differences due to the high level of similarity between sub-classes. Such distinctions are often lost as we downscale the image to save the memory and computational cost associated with vision transformers (ViT). In this work, we present an in-depth analysis and describe the critical components for developing a system for the fine-grained categorization of plants from herbarium sheets. Our extensive experimental analysis indicated the need for a better augmentation technique and the ability of modern-day neural networks to handle higher dimensional images. We also introduce a convolutional transformer architecture called Conviformer which, unlike the popular Vision Transformer (ConViT), can handle higher resolution images without exploding memory and computational cost. We also introduce a novel, improved pre-processing technique called PreSizer to resize images better while preserving their original aspect ratios, which proved essential for classifying natural plants. With our simple yet effective approach, we achieved SoTA on Herbarium 202x and iNaturalist 2019 dataset."  },  {    "@context": "https://schema.org",    "@type": "ScholarlyArticle",    "name": "A Benchmark for Compositional Visual Reasoning",    "author": {      "@type": "Person",      "name": "Mohit Vaishnav"    },    "datePublished": "2022",    "url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.05379",    "description": "A fundamental component of human vision is our ability to parse complex visual scenes and judge the relations between their constituent objects. AI benchmarks for visual reasoning have driven rapid progress in recent years with state-of-the-art systems now reaching human accuracy on some of these benchmarks. Yet, a major gap remains in terms of the sample efficiency with which humans and AI systems learn new visual reasoning tasks. Humans' remarkable efficiency at learning has been at least partially attributed to their ability to harness compositionality -- such that they can efficiently take advantage of previously gained knowledge when learning new tasks. Here, we introduce a novel visual reasoning benchmark, Compositional Visual Relations (CVR), to drive progress towards the development of more data-efficient learning algorithms. We take inspiration from fluidic intelligence and non-verbal reasoning tests and describe a novel method for creating compositions of abstract rules and associated image datasets at scale. Our proposed benchmark includes measures of sample efficiency, generalization and transfer across task rules, as well as the ability to leverage compositionality. We systematically evaluate modern neural architectures and find that, surprisingly, convolutional architectures surpass transformer-based architectures across all performance measures in most data regimes. However, all computational models are a lot less data efficient compared to humans even after learning informative visual representations using self-supervision. Overall, we hope that our challenge will spur interest in the development of neural architectures that can learn to harness compositionality toward more efficient learning."  }]

  <article class="post-content">
    <p>This theme supports rendering beautiful math in inline and display modes using <a href="https://www.mathjax.org/" target="\_blank">MathJax 3</a> engine. You just need to surround your math expression with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$$</code>, like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$$ E = mc^2 $$</code>. If you leave it inside a paragraph, it will produce an inline expression, just like \(E = mc^2\).</p>

<p>To use display mode, again surround your expression with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$$</code> and place it as a separate paragraph. Here is an example:</p>

\[\sum_{k=1}^\infty |\langle x, e_k \rangle|^2 \leq \|x\|^2\]

<p>You can also use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\begin{equation}...\end{equation}</code> instead of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$$</code> for display mode math.
MathJax will automatically number equations:</p>

<p>\begin{equation}
\label{eq:caushy-shwarz}
\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)
\end{equation}</p>

<p>and by adding <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\label{...}</code> inside the equation environment, we can now refer to the equation using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\eqref</code>.</p>

<p>Note that MathJax 3 is <a href="https://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/upgrading/whats-new-3.0.html" target="\_blank">a major re-write of MathJax</a> that brought a significant improvement to the loading and rendering speed, which is now <a href="http://www.intmath.com/cg5/katex-mathjax-comparison.php" target="\_blank">on par with KaTeX</a>.</p>
